# PhotoDB / AudioDB Documentation

PhotoDB and AudioDB are twin platforms for data management, processing, and annotation of image respective audio data.

This repository contains code for PhotoDB / AudioDB documentation (served as jekyll site) and the python package photodb_yolo_object_detection, which can be used to quickly train an Ultralytics YOLO model and integrate results into PhotoDB.
