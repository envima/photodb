# PhotoDB

PhotoDB is an open-source software for image data management, preprocessing, and annotation. It is highly customizable to fit a variety of use cases. It uses a sidecar yaml file approach for metadata handling, ensuring both human- and machine-readability, as well as easy access to metadata throughout the whole processing pipeline. At any point, metadata can be modified and extended by reading from and writing to the yaml files with arbitrary programming languages or scripting environments. Classification or detection models, like MegaDetector or any custom trained model, can be integrated via interaction with the metadata yaml files. PhotoDB offers the possibility to develop complex workflows covering the whole data life cycle from collection to analysis.
