Users can interact with PhotoDB / AudioDB over the web interface, PhotoApp / AudioApp.

Here, data entries may be inspected in detail, preprocessed, and annotated.

PhotoDB and AudioDB ustilize the YAML sidecar files metadata method. First, have a look at [this](/photodb_documentation/usage/metadata.html).

For PhotoDB, we also want to study the [definition of annotation classes](/photodb_documentation/usage/classfication_definition.html) and [image subsets (i.e. review lists)](/photodb_documentation/usage/review_lists.html).

Last but not least, look at some [tasks](/photodb_documentation/usage/tasks.html), PhotoDB / AudioDB can complete for you.
