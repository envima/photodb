# Running on Ubuntu

Start application server:

```bash
./audio.sh
```

Open web-interface (PhotoAPP) on a browser.
Local URL with default port 8080:

http://127.0.0.1:8080/

Stop server by key crtl-c or by closing the terminal.

**NOTE**: For images to appear in PhotoApp, corresponding metadata files need to exist. Go to [Tasks](tasks) to learn how to create metadata files via the **photo_create_yaml** task!
