Users can interact with PhotoDB over the web interface, PhotoApp. Here, images may be visually inspected, preprocessed, and annotated.

Before looking at PhotoApp in detail, let's have a closer look at the [YAML metadata method](/photodb_documentation/usage/metadata.html), the [definition of annotation classes](/photodb_documentation/usage/classfication_definition.html) and [image subsets (i.e. review lists)](/photodb_documentation/usage/review_lists.html), and some [tasks](/photodb_documentation/usage/tasks.html), PhotoDB can complete for you.
