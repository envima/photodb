Users can interact with PhotoDB / AudioDB over the web interface, PhotoApp / AudioApp.

Here, data entries may be inspected in detail, preprocessed, and annotated.

But first, let's have a closer look at the [YAML metadata method](/photodb_documentation/usage/metadata.html), the [definition of annotation classes](/photodb_documentation/usage/classfication_definition.html) and [image subsets (i.e. review lists)](/photodb_documentation/usage/review_lists.html), and some [tasks](/photodb_documentation/usage/tasks.html), PhotoDB / AudioDB can complete for you.
