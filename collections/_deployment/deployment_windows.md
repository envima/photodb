title: Deployment on Windows

### Using WSL

While deployment on windows is possible, deployment on Ubuntu is preferred. Some convenience scripts are currently included only for Ubuntu.

On Windows you may utilze `Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)` to run the application in Ubuntu mode inside of Ubuntu on Windows. Visit the [Ubuntu homepage](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl). to learn more about WSL.

## Prerequisite: Java 11

[Install Java](https://adoptium.net) 11 or newer.

## Download PhotoDB

If you still want to deploy on Windows, without WSL, simply download the [latest distribution package](https://github.com/Nature40/audiodb/releases/latest/download/package.zip) and extract it.

The distribution package includes some example files, that we will have a look at later on.
