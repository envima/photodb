The web application, PhotoApp, can now be opened in a browser.

If you configured an external server go to the corresponding address.

Stop server by key **ctrl-c** or by closing the terminal.

**NOTE**: For images to appear in PhotoApp, corresponding metadata files need to exist. Go to [Tasks](/photodb_documentation/usage/tasks.html) to learn how to create metadata files via the **photo_create_yaml** task!
